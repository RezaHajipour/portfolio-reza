                    Hey there! My name is Reza and I am a Fullstack Web
                    Developer based in Hamburg. <br />
                    At age of 22 I started to work in Radio and TV. During 20+
                    years I worked as directer and editor. I Was director of
                    Arroios Film Festival (Portugal) for 3 years and jury in
                    some international film festivals. <br />
                    Coding has, ever since I can recall, been something I was
                    eager to follow, so in 2021 took the first steps and
                    enrolled in WBS coding School bootcamp.
                    <br /> A year later, I wanted to improve my coding skills
                    then decided joining SPICED Academy. During my time there I
                    learned even more technologies and polished my existing
                    ones, and found myself in love with the idea of being a
                    Fullstack developer. <br />
                    At this point, I am a competent Fullstack Web Developer with
                    excellent communication skills and an avid problem solver
                    due to my previous work experience.
